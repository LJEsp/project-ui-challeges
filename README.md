# UI Challenges
I've subscribed to the daily UI challenges from http://www.dailyui.co/ to improve my UI skills.

You can view the designs I came up with here: https://ljesp.github.io/project-ui-challenges/

*Note that the focus of these challenges is the UI. Although I sometimes add functionality, some of the results' functionality may be either missing, incomplete, or buggy. Also, not all are mobile responsive.*

### Day 1: Sign Up — "Sentiment"

*I had this concept for a social app which I put most of my effort on. The sign up section was more of an afterthought. I've created reusable components for this challenge.*

### Day 2: Credit Card Checkout — "Orbital Skies"

*This challenge was difficult for me since there's a lot of ways of implemeting this UI and I'm clueless what the best practices are. I did some research but the outcome is still pretty barebones.*

### Day 3: Landing Page — "Blind Box"

*I watched the film Bird Box and I had this funny idea of a fashion store set in that universe. The outcome is stylish and I enjoyed animating it (not all of it, some parts were painful).*

### Day 4: Calculator — "Calculatey"

*I wanted to create something cute for this challenge and I also coded the calculator's functionality. Near the end I had the idea for the clear/reset numbers animation which I really liked (it is also where I realized the power of react-spring). This was the challenge where I first discovered and implemented the react-textfit package which allows me to make text fit their container as it scale which is very useful. This is the first UI I developed with the mobile-first approach. It made development a bit less painful and I do believe it is the better approach.*

### Day 5: App Icon — "Trevert"
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36854142/51082478-84837980-1742-11e9-92ff-6948397d5b66.png" alt="Trevert" width="500"/>

*I wasn't too excited in doing this challenge since I'm not great at making icons specially with the short amount of time. Still, I ended up with a design I'm satisfied with. The concept came from the word "revert" (hence the arrows pointing backwards). I added the T so that it becomes a palindrome. Perhaps it's an app for time travel.*

### Day 6: User Profile — "Elecy"
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36854142/51082500-f52a9600-1742-11e9-9f3b-8899326d4937.png" alt="Elecy" width="500"/>

*In this challenge I was inspired to make a super simple user profile interface. A lot of time was put into making the layout responsive in both mobile orientations. It's the first project I used grids in Figma for design which I believe helped in making a very solid layout (I used rows and columns in previous challenges).*

### Day 7: Settings *(Desktop Only)*
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36854142/51082490-bac0f900-1742-11e9-8680-258ab5e0441d.png" alt="Settings" width="500"/>

*For this challenge I wanted to make a modern UI for desktop that's friendly and easy on the eyes. The enter animation was enjoyable to make. The contents of this page came from GitHub's account settings.*

### Day 8: 404 — "Payapa"
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36854142/51082507-0bd0ed00-1743-11e9-96db-a81d7c8caa4b.png" alt="Payapa" width="500"/>

*This one is very simple. The main focus in this layout is creating the design elements in pure HTML and CSS. It's my first time coding a design like this. The combination of designing with grids and coding with space and size variables really helped a lot.*

### Day 9: Music Player — "Granite" *(Desktop Only)*
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36854142/51082568-7c2c3e00-1744-11e9-8a62-19f6e812e843.png" alt="Granite" width="500"/>

*This is one of the bigger UIs I've made. The challenge was to make a music player but I designed more of a Spotify-like site. Designing and coding each took a day.*

### Day 10: Social Share
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36854142/51086990-6b052080-1788-11e9-8973-519ab4b38f68.png" alt="Social Share" width="500"/>

*A simpe social share button. I wasn't able to create the animation I originally intended which requires a more advanced use of React-Spring.*
