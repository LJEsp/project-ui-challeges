# UI Challenges
I've subscribed to the daily UI challenges from http://www.dailyui.co/ to improve my UI skills.

You can view the designs I came up with here: https://ljesp.github.io/project-ui-challenges/

*Note that the focus of these challenges is the UI. Although I sometimes add functionality, some of the results' functionality may be either missing, incomplete, or buggy.*

### Day 1: Sign Up — "Sentiment"
*I had this concept for a social app which I put most of my effort on. The sign up section was more of an afterthought. I've created reusable components for this challenge.*

### Day 2: Credit Card Checkout — "Orbital Skies"
*This challenge was difficult for me since there's a lot of ways of implemeting this UI and I'm clueless what the best practices are. I did some research but the outcome is still pretty barebones.*

### Day 3: Landing Page — "Blind Box"
*I watched the film Bird Box and I had this funny idea of a fashion store set in that universe. The outcome is stylish and I enjoyed animating it (not all of it, some parts were painful).*

### Day 4: Calculator — "Calculatey"
*I wanted to create something cute for this challenge and I also coded the calculator's functionality. Near the end I had the idea for the clear/reset numbers animation which I really liked (it is also where I realized the power of react-spring). This was the challenge where I first discovered and implemented the react-textfit package which allows me to make text fit their container as it scale which is very useful. This is the first UI I developed with the mobile-first approach. It made development a bit less painful and I do believe it is the better approach.*

### Day 5: App Icon — "Trevert"
*I wasn't too excited in doing this challenge since I'm not great at making icons specially with the short amount of time. Still, I ended up with a design I'm satisfied with. The concept came from the word "revert" (hence the arrows pointing backwards). I added the T so that it becomes a palindrome. Perhaps it's an app for time travel.*

### Day 6: User Profile — "Elecy"
*In this challenge I was inspired to make a super simple user profile interface. A lot of time was put into making the layout responsive in both mobile orientations. It's the first project I used grids in Figma for layout (I used rows and columns in previous challenges).*
